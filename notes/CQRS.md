CQRS stands for **Command Query Responsibility Segregation**. It's a **design pattern** used in software architecture to **separate**:

* **Commands**: operations that **change state** (like *create, update, delete*),
* **Queries**: operations that **return data** (read-only, no side effects).

### 🔄 Key Idea

Traditionally, we use the same data model for both **reading** and **writing**. But in CQRS, we **split** them to **optimize** each side independently.

| Aspect         | Commands (Write)          | Queries (Read)            |
| -------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Responsibility | Modify data (state)       | Retrieve data             |
| Return Value   | Usually void or ID        | Returns data              |
| Model          | Domain model, validations | DTOs, optimized for reads |
| Transactional  | Yes                       | Usually no                |

### ✅ Benefits of CQRS

* **Scalability**: Read and write workloads can scale independently.
* **Optimized Queries**: Read models can be tailored for specific UI or report needs.
* **Separation of Concerns**: Write logic focuses on business rules; read logic focuses on performance.
* **Security**: Read and write access can be controlled separately.

### ❌ When Not to Use

* Overkill for **simple CRUD** apps.
* Adds **complexity**, especially with **eventual consistency** and **event sourcing**.

---

### 🏗 Example Use Case

Let’s say you have a **Banking App**:

* ✅ Query: "Get my account balance" → hits a read database or read service.
* ❌ Command: "Transfer ₹1000 to another account" → goes through domain validation, state change, and event publishing.

### 🔧 Technologies Often Used With CQRS

* **Spring Boot + Axon Framework**
* **Event Sourcing**
* **Apache Kafka / RabbitMQ** (for asynchronous commands/events)
* **Separate Read/Write databases** (eventually consistent)

   |-----> [Command API] -----> [Command Handler] -----> [Write DB]
   |
   |-----> [Query API]   -----> [Query Handler]   -----> [Read DB]
```
